*  Calibrated test equipment.
It's a phone.
An aliexpress cheap thing
Accelerometer unknown.
9.8 g in z
9.6 in x & y
quick linearity check:
balanced x + y:
x + y => 9.6
Seems good enough.

Range?
Could be 2.0g. Could be 4.0g. I could find out... with non-free applications!!
** One more check
very confusing. Shouldn't most of the action been in z?
The sensitivity of x & y vs z seems different. z hardly moves. X & Y do. Z looks like it's low pass filtered. Nope. It has a strong non-linear component. The other channels are probably suss too.

Work-around: rotate phone (for science) [fn::Sometimes it feels silly how something made by made that should be neatly structure and deterministic requires a /science/.]
