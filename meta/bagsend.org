Good day.

*** viewport shenanigans
want to make it Mobile friendly

  /*
  snippet from 
  https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/responsive-design
  Lets the device set the width
  */

The meta viewport tag lets it scale, but is ugly on desktop -> want page to max out at 600 px or so.

changed width to max-width in body. Did nothing afaik

but if I put an empty div block before body, then it works...

I don't get it!
I think the names here are supposed to match with the names in the .html.
From that it looks like *body* is the important one - it is the post body.

In fact, nothing I change in body seems to have effect...
When I comment out meta viewport it works.

ohhhh is the meta supposed to be in the .html?
Yeah, I think so.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
goes in .html. Changine width to max-width in body now does te trick. It seems to work without meta viewport in the html.

I will add it to the .html -> google mobile check doesn't like it.

Note that gwern has it in his .html
** foundation
having trouble putting it on.
need to copy folder to _site
but can't even get web based to work

some kind of autogenerate is at work.
get a different data-tabs generated each time I reload the working example.

If I copy the working one into the root of bg:

works if I have:

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="foundation/css/foundation.css">
   <script src="foundation/js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
   <script src="foundation/js/vendor/foundation.min.js"></script>

doesn't work if I have:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="foundation/css/foundation.css">
   <script src="/foundation/js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
   <script src="/foundation/js/vendor/foundation.min.js"></script>

those forward slashes!

** Learning the lay of the land
*** Static site generators
Software that creates websites whose pages are static HTML; the HTML is not generated on the fly. These sites might still contain Javascript & the like.
*** Markup:
A language for writing documents that includes syntax for special representation, e.g. links, images, italics.
*** Pandoc
Converts between different markup formats
Can actually handle .org files, at least in a limited way!
https://zeitkraut.de/posts/2014-02-28-emacs-org-mode.html
Sweet!
*** Hakyll
A static site generator.
In Haskell
Uses pandoc
Not sure what it does
organises files, images etc?

Pretty much just feeds pandoc with various rules set in site.hs. Then adds extra html templates to the output. + some miscellaneous tags, metadata, niceties
*** Math
**** Image based
Using imagemajick
Old school, no JS.
**** MathJax
Modern, standard.
Uses javascript loaded from AMS to display math.
*** Org mode abilities
**** Math
Can handle math, using LaTex
e.g:

\begin{equation}
x=\sqrt{b}
\end{equation}

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

The above can be displayed in emacs using:

And reverted back to source using:

**** HTML export
Can export to HTML.
Includes math.
This is handy, but this is only per file. So, I would have to recompile every file that gets changed, or even just have a one page webpage (bad idea).
Need emacs to handle a /website/ not just a webpage.
**** Latex export
Can't handle URL's in section titles.
Nesting depth limit?
**** Tangling
Will have to try this out with a simple script
*** Emacs static site generators
**** using pandoc on org files.
Need separate file per post
Looks super legit though
** Mass adjusted life years.
Do fat people actually live for longer, if we count mass, or number of cells, not single beings?

** Pandoc
*** Trying to customise pandoc options
**** tried to add extra module by _ in stack.yaml:

 # Packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver (e.g., acme-missiles-0.3)
 extra-deps:
 - text-1.2.2.


 OR could probably have gone =stack install text=

 maybe https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/


*** What goes through Pandoc
 Anything in a post makes it to the output. Though Comment blocks do appear to be handled as expected.
 
 Commented out stuff in html templates makes it trough to the output.
** Publishing
 currently have a wobbly script. could look at just using git, and then having a hook on git push to also run a sync with the server
** Site generation
*** Hung process
find pid:
sudo netstat -nlp|grep 8000
kill:
kill -1 pid
** Standards
*** footnotes
[fn::actually, not actually]
"The quoted advice suggests that, if a footnote consists of a phrase or sentence fragment, you need not capitalize it or end it with a period (or any other end punctuation). Otherwise capitalise"
** Stats
wordcounts
Use final output - includes html
Use org input - includes comments

ideal - count in org
This is the sensible approach. Will try, if fail leave it for a better time

How to count in org?
can get counts in mode bar
But frequencies?
** Versioning and 'behind the scenes' would be so cool - different tabs at the top, built in evolution of the page. Git is definitely a gem here :)
** Webcam
*** Ended up on the subject of periodically capturing webcam and screen images.
 No idea how I ended up chasing this.
 Anyway, it's all set up now.
 And I can say that the most exciting way to hack is to set up a cron job running every minute, on a script you are trying to get to work. I displayed seconds in the notifications area so I could see when the minute was about to roll over & I would have to save and watch the new attempt fail/suceed.

Could be a 'meta' section of the site. Or maybe 'dev'.
Would share my workings, and my todos.

Do I really need a private place for bagsend notes?
- server set up

So maybe it is best that I keep some things private. Though it could be an early test-bed of radical openness.

** OPT post blurbs?
** OPT Move to new drafts system
what is the new drafts system?

I think http://www.limansky.me/posts/2015-10-31-Draft-posts-with-Hakyll.html
might be the way to go.

BUT.
This is work and effort so in future I can put off *completing* things. Seems bad. If anything I want pressure to complete things. I suppose there is a balance to not making it easy to start. I think that is less of a problem. Also C-c c n capture template exists and is pretty legit.
