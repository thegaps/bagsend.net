*** viewport shenanigans
want to make it Mobile friendly

  /*
  snippet from 
  https://developers.google.com/webmasters/mobile-sites/mobile-seo/responsive-design
  Lets the device set the width
  */

The meta viewport tag lets it scale, but is ugly on desktop -> want page to max out at 600 px or so.

changed width to max-width in body. Did nothing afaik

but if I put an empty div block before body, then it works...

I don't get it!
I think the names here are supposed to match with the names in the .html.
From that it looks like *body* is the important one - it is the post body.

In fact, nothing I change in body seems to have effect...
When I comment out meta viewport it works.

ohhhh is the meta supposed to be in the .html?
Yeah, I think so.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
goes in .html. Changine width to max-width in body now does te trick. It seems to work without meta viewport in the html.

I will add it to the .html -> google mobile check doesn't like it.

Note that gwern has it in his .html
** foundation
having trouble putting it on.
need to copy folder to _site
but can't even get web based to work

some kind of autogenerate is at work.
get a different data-tabs generated each time I reload the working example.

If I copy the working one into the root of bg:

works if I have:

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="foundation/css/foundation.css">
   <script src="foundation/js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
   <script src="foundation/js/vendor/foundation.min.js"></script>

doesn't work if I have:
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="foundation/css/foundation.css">
   <script src="/foundation/js/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
   <script src="/foundation/js/vendor/foundation.min.js"></script>

** Learning the lay of the land
*** Static site generators
Software that creates websites whose pages are static HTML; the HTML is not generated on the fly. These sites might still contain Javascript & the like.
*** Markup:
A language for writing documents that includes syntax for special representation, e.g. links, images, italics.
*** Pandoc
Converts between different markup formats
Can actually handle .org files, at least in a limited way!
https://zeitkraut.de/posts/2014-02-28-emacs-org-mode.html
Sweet!
*** Hakyll
A static site generator.
In Haskell
Uses pandoc
Not sure what it does
organises files, images etc?

Pretty much just feeds pandoc with various rules set in site.hs. Then adds extra html templates to the output. + some miscellaneous tags, metadata, niceties
*** Math
**** Image based
Using imagemajick
Old school, no JS.
**** MathJax
Modern, standard.
Uses javascript loaded from AMS to display math.
*** Org mode abilities
**** Math
Can handle math, using LaTex
e.g:

\begin{equation}
x=\sqrt{b}
\end{equation}

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

The above can be displayed in emacs using:

And reverted back to source using:

**** HTML export
Can export to HTML.
Includes math.
This is handy, but this is only per file. So, I would have to recompile every file that gets changed, or even just have a one page webpage (bad idea).
Need emacs to handle a /website/ not just a webpage.
**** Latex export
Can't handle URL's in section titles.
Nesting depth limit?
**** Tangling
Will have to try this out with a simple script
*** Emacs static site generators
**** using pandoc on org files.
Need separate file per post
Looks super legit though
** Mass adjusted life years.
Do fat people actually live for longer, if we count mass, or number of cells, not single beings?

** Pandoc
*** Trying to customise pandoc options
**** tried to add extra module by _ in stack.yaml:

 # Packages to be pulled from upstream that are not in the resolver (e.g., acme-missiles-0.3)
 extra-deps:
 - text-1.2.2.


 OR could probably have gone =stack install text=

 maybe https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/


*** What goes through Pandoc
 Anything in a post makes it to the output. Though Comment blocks do appear to be handled as expected.
 
 Commented out stuff in html templates makes it trough to the output.
** Publishing
 currently have a wobbly script. could look at just using git, and then having a hook on git push to also run a sync with the server
** Site generation
*** Hung process
find pid:
sudo netstat -nlp|grep 8000
kill:
kill -1 pid
** Standards
*** footnotes
[fn::actually, not actually]
"The quoted advice suggests that, if a footnote consists of a phrase or sentence fragment, you need not capitalize it or end it with a period (or any other end punctuation). Otherwise capitalise"
** Stats
wordcounts
Use final output - includes html
Use org input - includes comments

ideal - count in org
This is the sensible approach. Will try, if fail leave it for a better time

How to count in org?
can get counts in mode bar
But frequencies?
** Versioning and 'behind the scenes' would be so cool - different tabs at the top, built in evolution of the page. Git is definitely a gem here :)
** Webcam
*** Ended up on the subject of periodically capturing webcam and screen images.
 No idea how I ended up chasing this.
 Anyway, it's all set up now.
 And I can say that the most exciting way to hack is to set up a cron job running every minute, on a script you are trying to get to work. I displayed seconds in the notifications area so I could see when the minute was about to roll over & I would have to save and watch the new attempt fail/suceed.
** Website examples / style
http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm
** Workflow
*** A typical software mini-project I do might follow the following timeline:
 1) Start a project .org file
    1) Could be in a project folder or in the bagsend drafts folder
 2) (in project file) write general descriptive ramble, describe project motivation 
 3) (in project file) collect links, random ideas. Maybe include some early code fragments
 4) start writing code
    1) source usually located where it will be used, or in a project folder (outside bags)
       1) use version control if it will be useful
    2) less often, source starts out as a code block
 5) Continue to develop code
    1) (in project file) ongoing results and references recorded in project file
 6) Collect neccessary data
    1) Usually located in project folder, or bagsend docs folder
 7) Create a bagsend post
    1) Either create a new document, or migrate existing project file to a post
 8) Publish bagsend post with script included in post body
 9) Continue to develop script in isolation, don't update anything else
*** This raises the following (potential) problems:
 1) Posts don't get updated
 2) The latest version of code might not be available
 3) The post is usually written in a style that introduces an idea. It would be weird to just update the code without updating the surrounding post. Updating the post could mean a complete re-write, and possibly require changing the post tense.
 4) If a project is migrated to a post, there is no longer a place for random free-form cruft.
*** These problems raise the following questions:
 1) What is the purpose of a post?
    1) capture a snapshot of a project in time
    2) be a complete reference for a project, as it develops over time
    => I value both of these
 2) What catagories of _things_ do I want?
    1) Posts and projects?
       - what's the difference?
    2) Structure reduced to 'primary' components? e.g Have the following objects (which are rehased as sensible):
       - Introduction / motivation blurb
       - code segment
       - results / comments
 3) If a post is the only project file, and I go all-out using code blocks (no separate code files), how would version control work?
    1) Would a bags post get an update every time a source code block changes?
       1) then version control is pretty messy - no repo for code for just that project.
	  1) Aha! but is there some git mechanism that would help?
	     1) tags
	     2) submodules
    2) Can I work efficiently with code-blocks? At the moment it adds an extra step to the coding process (more emacs-fu required)
    3) Should I make room somewhere for scripts I don't think are worth publishing at all?
    4) Do I want bags to be the process (slighlty polished) or one of many outputs of the process?
       1) If the former then it might be more worthwhile to look at the project process I follow and tie that together, then look a methods of publishing it from the native format
 4) Is this project at risk of being swallowed up by the drive towards a personal workbook? The success of this site (as a method to get /anything/ intelligible written down) might be dependant on it's current simplicity / loose format. The current way is not completely broken.
    - Do not introduce more steps to be taken
    - Keep changes small
*** Thoughts:
 I could use comment blocks to mitigate problem #4.
 _Every little script_ having it's own repo seems overkill.
The polar opposite is having many unrelated things in one repo. This causes problems: how do you go back to an earlier verion of project A (maybe to debug), without changing files in other projects. Can you do a checkout limited to certain files?
Middle grounds:
- everything in a shared repo 'pending'
  - until they become big enough to justify their own repo
- organise projects into catagories. Each catagory is a repo
*** Possible workflow #1
1) start a draft org post
2) write code / scratch around in draft post
3) publish post (no longer draft)
4) stop here if project is complete / abandoned, or continue if it warrants further development
5) create org project file + project repo, in bagsend/projects/
6) continue to develop code, use code blocks in project file
7) project files are displayed somewhere on bags
   1) probably don't want them put at the top of the landing page heap every time they are updated
8) add link from inital post to project file
9) continue to develop code, use code blocks in project file
10) Anything remarkable from further dev could go into orignal post. Or into a new post. Or stay in the project file. Hmmm[fn::I think this is where the crux of the problem Im trying to solve has moved too. It's like: "Here is a problem with the task you want to do" (tosses problem). You can either: Solve it, determine the problem is insolvable, and is completely coupled to the desired task, or decrease the scope of effect of the problem so it is smaller than the task you want to achieve. Weak example: Task:Mow the lawns this week. Problem1: My lawns are made of diamond. Outcome: Mow lawns with superhard cutting blades. Problem2: I don't have any lawns. Outcome2: Don't mow the lawns. Problem3: The lawns don't exist on Wednesdays. Outcome3: Don't attempt to mow the lawns on a Wednesday.].
*** Possible workflow #2
1) Start a project in a literate org file
2) Once viable:
   1) org file gets version controlled
   2) org file gets published on bags
   3) org file gets pushed to github
   4) tangled output automatically added to project folder, or maybe 'tangled' folder
3) Continue dev, working in the version controlled org files
   1) repeat push process - Bags gets update every git push, or maybe weekly

A possible structure:
- bagsend (bags repo root)
  - projects
    - project1.org
    - project2.org
    - code
      - project1.py
      - project2.py
      - +complete_project.py+
    - big_project (own repo, a submodule of bags)
      - big_project.org
      - code
	- big_project.py
      - data
	- big_project.csv
  - posts
    - story1.org
    - project2_introduction.org (links to ../projects/projec2.org)
    - +complete_project.org+

Where any code in a post does not get put anywhere else.
Or each project could get it's own folder, whether a submodule or not. Seems tidier, and easier to transition between submodule status.
Will sit on it [2017-10-11 Wed 22:25] ...

A re-read shows that this is pretty much the same as #1.
*** Actually different possible workflow #3
1) All projects start in their own project folder, outside of bags.
2) I might make a post on bags about a project, or something entirely different.
3) It doesn't really matter
*** Conclusion
Do #1 and #2

- server set up

So maybe it is best that I keep some things private. Though it could be an early test-bed of radical openness.

** OPT post blurbs?
** OPT Move to new drafts system
what is the new drafts system?

I think http://www.limansky.me/posts/2015-10-31-Draft-posts-with-Hakyll.html
might be the way to go.

BUT.
This is work and effort so in future I can put off *completing* things. Seems bad. If anything I want pressure to complete things. I suppose there is a balance to not making it easy to start. I think that is less of a problem. Also C-c c n capture template exists and is pretty legit.
